*DNS queries emitted by your computer:*
-Filter the traffic in Wireshark with the filter "dns"
-Observe the DNS queries and responses exchanged between your computer and the DNS server.

*Traffic coming from another VM*
- Send queries from the other VM (otherIP address) and filter the traffic in Wireshark with that IP address
- Observe the traffic exchanged with the peer's computer, including DNS queries, TCP connections, and HTTP requests and responses.
- Compare the observed traffic with the traffic captured by running Wireshark on the peer's laptop.

*Inspect traffic from an unsecure website*
- Browse to an unsecure http://www.perdu.com
- Observe the HTTP requests and responses exchanged with the website, including the GET request and the HTML response.
- Notice that the traffic is transmitted in plain text and can be intercepted and read by any network intermediary,
  making it susceptible to eavesdropping and attacks like man-in-the-middle.
